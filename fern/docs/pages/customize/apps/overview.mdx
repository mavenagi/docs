Apps extend Maven's core functionality by connecting to external services and adding new features to your agent.

## What Are Apps?

Apps are integrations that allow Maven to:

- Connect to your CX systems (Zendesk, Salesforce, etc.)
- Import knowledge from external sources
- Execute actions in third-party services
- Customize agent behavior

## Managing Apps

Navigate to **Apps** in Agent Designer to:

- Browse available apps in the App Directory
- Install and configure apps for your agent
- Manage app settings and credentials
- View app status and logs

## Getting Started

1. Go to **Agent Designer > Apps > App Directory**
2. Browse available apps or search for a specific integration
3. Click **Install** on the app you want to add
4. Configure the required settings and credentials
5. Save your configuration

For detailed setup instructions for specific integrations, see the [CX Integrations](/docs/cx-integrations) section.
