User permissions define the level of Maven access a user in your organization will have. Usually, permissions are based on a user's role, though organization-level permissions.

The person who sets user permissions is the Admin or Owner. The Admin is the first user of any Maven organization, and each organization must have at least one Admin (any Admin can designate other users as Admins as well). When new users are invited to an organization, they are assigned the role set during the invitation process.
