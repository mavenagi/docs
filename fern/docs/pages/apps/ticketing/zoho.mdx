Maven provides an integration with Zoho Desk that enables automatic knowledge base synchronization and ticket creation directly from conversations.

## Features

- **Knowledge Base Ingestion**: Automatically syncs published Zoho Desk articles to Maven
- **Ticket Creation**: Create support tickets directly from conversations
- **Contact Management**: Automatically creates and links contacts in Zoho Desk
- **Conversation Transcripts**: Attaches full conversation history to tickets as private comments

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Zoho Desk integration, you'll need to obtain the following from your Zoho Desk account:

- **Client ID** - Your Zoho OAuth Client ID
- **Client Secret** - Your Zoho OAuth Client Secret
- **Refresh Token** - OAuth refresh token for API access
- **Organization ID** - Your Zoho Desk organization ID
- **Department ID** - The department where tickets will be created

## Setup within Zoho Desk

### Step 1: Generate OAuth Refresh Token

The easiest way to generate your OAuth credentials is to use our automated token generator:

**https://zoho-auth.onmaven.app**

This tool will guide you through:
1. Creating your Zoho OAuth app
2. Authorizing the app
3. Generating your refresh token

<Accordion title="Manual OAuth Setup">

If you prefer to set up OAuth manually:

1. **Create a Server-based OAuth App**:
   - Go to [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com)
   - Click **ADD CLIENT** > **Server-based Applications**
   - Fill in your application details
   - Add redirect URI: `https://zoho-auth.onmaven.app/callback`
   - Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

2. **Enable Required Scopes**:
   - `Desk.tickets.ALL` - For ticket creation
   - `Desk.articles.READ` - For knowledge base article access
   - `Desk.contacts.ALL` - For contact management

3. **Generate Refresh Token**:
   - Use the token generator tool linked above, or
   - Follow Zoho's OAuth documentation to generate a refresh token manually

</Accordion>

### Step 2: Find Your Zoho IDs

**Organization ID:**
1. Log in to Zoho Desk
2. Go to **Settings > Developer Space > API**
3. Your Organization ID (OrgId) is displayed on this page

**Department ID:**
1. In Zoho Desk, go to **Settings > Channels & Departments > Departments**
2. Click on the department you want to use for ticket creation
3. The department ID is in the URL: `.../departments/[DEPARTMENT_ID]`

## Setup within Maven

1. In Maven AGI, navigate to your agent
2. Go to **Apps** and find **Zoho Desk**
3. Enter the following settings:

| Setting | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Client ID** | Yes | Your Zoho OAuth Client ID |
| **Client Secret** | Yes | Your Zoho OAuth Client Secret |
| **Refresh Token** | Yes | The OAuth refresh token from Step 1 |
| **Organization ID** | Yes | Your Zoho Desk Organization ID |
| **Department ID** | Yes | The department ID where tickets will be created |

4. Click **Install**

The app will automatically:
- Validate your credentials
- Ingest your knowledge base articles
- Create ticket creation actions

## Knowledge Base Sync

Maven automatically syncs published articles from your Zoho Desk knowledge base:

- **Filters**: Only articles that are **Published** and visible to **All Users** are synced
- **Content Conversion**: HTML content is converted to Markdown for optimal AI processing
- **Auto-refresh**: Knowledge base is updated periodically to keep content fresh

<Note>
Articles that are in Draft status or only visible to Agents/Registered Users will not be synced.
</Note>

## Ticket Creation

When Maven cannot fully resolve a user's inquiry, it can create a support ticket in Zoho Desk. Two actions are available:

**For Identified Users:**
- Appears when user has name and email in their profile
- Pre-fills contact information automatically

**For Unidentified Users:**
- Appears when user information is not available
- Prompts for name and email before creating the ticket

Both actions:
- Create or link to an existing contact in Zoho Desk
- Create a ticket in the specified department
- Attach the full conversation transcript as a private comment

## Supported Data Centers

This integration supports all Zoho data centers:

| Region | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| United States | accounts.zoho.com |
| Europe | accounts.zoho.eu |
| India | accounts.zoho.in |
| Australia | accounts.zoho.com.au |
| Japan | accounts.zoho.jp |
| Canada | accounts.zohocloud.ca |
| China | accounts.zoho.com.cn |

Make sure to select the correct data center when generating your refresh token.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Credentials Error
- Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
- Ensure your refresh token is valid and hasn't expired
- Verify you're using the correct data center

### No Articles Ingested
- Check that articles are published with visibility set to **All Users** (not just Agents)
- Verify your Organization ID is correct
- Ensure the OAuth scopes include `Desk.articles.READ`

### Ticket Creation Fails
- Verify Department ID is correct
- Check OAuth scopes include `Desk.tickets.ALL` and `Desk.contacts.ALL`
- Ensure your Zoho Desk plan supports API access
