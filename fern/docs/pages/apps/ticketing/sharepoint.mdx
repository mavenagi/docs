## Setup within Maven

**Knowledge:**

In order to set up the SharePoint integration, you will to be a SharePoint administrator.

1. **Create a SharePoint App Registration**:
   - Go to https://entra.microsoft.com/ Applications > App Registrations > New Registration
   - Enter app name, select "Multitenant", click "Register"

2. **Create Client ID and Client Secret for your app**:
    - Go to the App Overview page
    - Your Tenant ID is listed under "Directory (tenant) ID".
    - Copy the Tenant ID value (you will need it later)
    - Select "Client credentials" > "Add a certificate or secret"
    - Under the "Client Secrets" tab, click "New client secret", enter a description, click "Add".
    - Copy the value of the client secret (you will need it later)

3. **Create a Certificate for Certificate Authorization**:
    - Generate a certificate and private key pair.
      You can use tools like OpenSSL or PowerShell to create a self-signed certificate.
    - Save the certificate file (e.g., `sharepoint-cert.cer`) and the private key file (e.g., `sharepoint-key.pem`).
    - Upload your certificate into SharePoint. You need to be an Azure administrator to add Certificates.
    - Store and save the generated Thumbprint value (you will need it later)

4. **Grant Permissions to the App**:
    - On the App page, select the "API Permissions" tab
    - On Graph, grant "Files.Read.All", "Sites.Read.All"
    - On Sharepoint, grant "Sites.FullControl.All", "Sites.Read.All"
    - Administrator permissions may be needed to delegate

5. **Configure the Maven SharePoint App**:
    - Go to the Maven Agent Designer
    - Navigate to Apps > App Directory > Browse & Install
    - Install the SharePoint app
    - Enter the following settings:
      - `tenantId`: Your Tenant ID from step 2
      - `clientId`: The Client ID from step 2
      - `clientSecret`: The Client Secret from step 2
      - `certificateThumbprint`: The Thumbprint value from step 3
      - `private-key.pem`: The contents of your private key file (e.g., `sharepoint-key.pem`) from step 3
         Do not include the key headers. Only the base64-encoded key content should be included.

    - Click "Save" to complete the setup. By default, all SharePoint sites will be included.
      You may optionally enter a list of specific site URLs to include
