**Setup within Maven**

To install this app you will need:

Pipeline ID

* Enter the ID of the HubSpot pipeline where you want Maven to create tickets.   
* You can find this in your HubSpot account under the Sales Pipeline settings.

Access Token

* Paste your HubSpot Private App Access Token. This token allows Maven to authenticate and create tickets on your behalf.   
* You can generate this token from your HubSpot account under Private Apps.

Pipeline Stage ID

* Provide the ID of the specific pipeline stage where tickets should be created within the selected pipeline. This ensures tickets land in the correct stage of your process.

**Knowledge:**

Maven will ingest articles from the HubSpot Knowledge Base, organizing them by category. Each HubSpot category will be represented as a separate knowledgebase within Maven, containing its associated articles.  The frequency of the sync/updates can be adjusted by updating the Knowledge Base settings in Maven.  

**Ticket Hand Off:**

When Maven cannot deflect a user inquiry, a ticket is created in the HubSpot system. Ticket hand off is represented as an action within Maven. A ticket can be created for authenticated users and anonymous users.
