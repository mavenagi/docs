**Setup within Maven**

Install the Freskdesk app via Agent Designer  
* Navigate to the Agent Designer dashboard  
* Select Apps \> App Directory \> Browse & Install  
* Install Fresdesk

To install, you will need:

* Your FreshDesk API key: How to find your API key  
* Your FreshDesk subdomain: https://yoursubdomain.freshdesk.com  
* Optional language (if left blank, 'en' is the default)

If it is not successful, double check your subdomain. As an example, if your freshdesk url is http://yourcompany.freshdesk.com, then your subdomain would be “yourcompany”.

**Knowledge:**

Maven will pull in articles from the Freshdesk Knowledge Base.

**Ticket Hand Off:**

When Maven cannot deflect a user inquiry, a ticket is created in the Freshdesk system. Ticket hand off is represented as an action within Maven. A ticket can be created for authenticated users and anonymous users.


**Live Agent Handoff - Comming Q2 2025**

Live Agent Handoff will start a live chat with a human agent as a result of a handoff action.
