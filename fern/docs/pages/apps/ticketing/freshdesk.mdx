## Setup within Maven
To set up the Freshdesk integration, you will need to first [make an API key](https://support.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/215517-how-to-find-your-api-key) for your Freshdesk account.

Once you have an API key, enter your Freshdesk subdomain and the key in the Maven Freshdesk integration settings. 
After you click "Save", you will see a message below the Freshdesk 
settings letting you know whether the connection is successful.

If it is not successful double check your subdomain. As an example, if your freshdesk url
is http://yourcompany.freshdesk.com, then your subdomain would be "yourcompany".

### Optional: Custom tag field
Use this setting if you have a custom freshdesk field you'd like to use to tag conversations within Maven. 
Note that custom freshdesk fields always start with "cf_".

## Setup within Freshdesk
Once your Maven settings are configured, [install the Freshdesk plugin](https://www.freshworks.com/apps/maven_agi_co-pilot/)
from the Freshdesk Marketplace.

This plugin has one required field: the Agent API key that is displayed on the Maven Freshdesk settings page.
