## Setup within Maven

Maven needs several pieces of information to connect to your Salesforce instance.

1. First find your Salesforce domain which is the first portion of your URL (e.g. https://mycompany.my.salesforce.com)
2. Then find your Organization ID which is listed under Company Information within the Salesforce's Settings page (e.g. 00AA10000001AAA)

After you click "Save", you will see a message below the Salesforce
settings letting you know whether the connection is successful. 

Optionally, if you wish to use your own connected app, enter a custom App Client Id/Secret.

You can also optionally enter the name of the custom field name used for the first user message if your 
salesforce setup does start with an EmailMessage.

## Setup within Salesforce

1. Install the Maven AGI plugin from the marketplace.
2. Then create an integration user from the Salesforce admin panel.
3. Edit the policy for the Maven connected app to run the Client Credentials Flow as the integration user.
4. This integration user needs to be given Read permissions to the Case object and Email Messages object. Using a separate Permission Set for Maven AGI is recommended.
  - The recommended Case field permissions include: Id, SuppliedName, SuppliedEmail, Subject, Description, CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate, CreatedById and LastModifiedById.
  - The recommended Email Message field permissions include: Id, TextBody, FromName, Incoming, CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate, CreatedById and LastModifiedById.
5. If you wish for Salesforce tickets to be created from within Maven AGI, Create access to the Case object and Edit access to above Case fields is also required.
