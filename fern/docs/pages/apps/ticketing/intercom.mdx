Maven provides an integration that allows it to participate in Intercom workflows via a Custom Action.

## Configure Maven

To get started, install the Intercom App from the Maven App directory:

![Install Intercom App from Maven App Directory](/docs/assets/intercom/01_Intercom_App_Directory.png)

Create an authentication token to be used between the services using a random number generator (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`). Configure that secret during the installation. Also, provide a comma-separated list of escalation topics that can signal to Intercom that Maven thinks it should escalate the conversation to a ticket (this can be tuned later).

![Configure Authentication Token and Escalation Topics](/docs/assets/intercom/02_Intercom_Install.png)

## Configure Intercom

Navigate to **Settings** -> **Integration** -> **Authentication** in Intercom and create a record for the token created above.

![Create Authentication Record in Intercom](/docs/assets/intercom/03_Intercom_Authentication.png)

The Maven Custom Action will return its response into a custom attribute on the conversation. Navigate to **Data** -> **Conversations** and add custom attributes for `Maven Response` and `Maven Status`.

![Create Conversation Attributes in Intercom](/docs/assets/intercom/04_Intercom_New_Attributes.png)

The action itself is an API call to Maven with a URL that encodes both your organization and agent ID. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Integration** -> **Custom Actions** and create a new record.

On the **About** page, set the Action Usage to be **Workflows and Help Desk**.

![Set Action Usage to Workflows and Help Desk](/docs/assets/intercom/06_Intercom_Custom_Action_Page_1.png)

On the **API Connection** page, set the URL to:

https://intercom.onmaven.app/api/{ORG_ID}/{AGENT_ID}/webhook

Replace `{ORG_ID}` and `{AGENT_ID}` with your actual organization and agent IDs. Configure the authentication token from above as an authorization header.

![Configure API Connection and Authorization Header](/docs/assets/intercom/07_Intercom_Custom_Action_Page_2.png)

The request values need to be mapped to a JSON structure using Intercom values as shown below. Use the Intercom variable tool to inject `Last Message Body`, `Maven Status`, `Conversation ID`, `Last Message ID` and optionally `User ID`.

```json
{
  "conversation_id" : "$CONVERSATION_ID",
  "q": "$LAST_MESSAGE_BODY",
  "message_id" : "$LAST_MESSAGE_ID"
  "status" : "$MAVEN_STATUS",
  "user_id" : "$USER_ID",
}
```

On the Test Response page, provide arbitrary values and ensure that a response comes back in the proper form.

![Send Test Response](/docs/assets/intercom/08_Intercom_Custom_Action_Page_3.png)

Once the message is returned, map the response values for text and status to the conversation attributes created above.

## Integrating into a Workflow

To integrate the custom action into a workflow, add it to the flow using Intercom’s builder.

![Integrate into Workflow](/docs/assets/intercom/10_Intercom_Workflow.png)

## Logging

Action logs are available in the logs panel of the Intercom Custom Action.

## Limitations

The major limitation is that streaming responses are only available through Maven’s chat interface and not through third-party chat interfaces like those of Intercom.
