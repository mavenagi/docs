## Setup within Maven
To set up the Zendesk integration, you will need to first [make an API key](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Managing-access-to-the-Zendesk-API#topic_bsw_lfg_mmb) for your Zendesk account.

Once you have an API key, enter your Zendesk subdomain, username you used to make your API key and the key 
itself in the Maven Zendesk integration settings. After you click "Save", you will see a message below the Zendesk 
settings letting you know whether the connection is successful.

If it is not successful: 
- first [check your subdomain](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409381383578-Where-can-I-find-my-Zendesk-subdomain)
- next check your username. It must belong to the account you used to make your API key.
- finally, make sure that account has enough permissions to access the Zendesk API. Only admin accounts can allow API access.

## Setup within Zendesk
Once your Maven settings are configured, [install the Zendesk plugin](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/982238/maven-agi-co-pilot/) from the Zendesk Marketplace.

This plugin has one required field: the Agent API key that is displayed on the Maven Zendesk settings page.
