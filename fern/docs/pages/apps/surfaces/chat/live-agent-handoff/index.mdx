## Common Features

Many providers support common features such as:

- **Agent Availability** - Control when live agent handoff is available based on business hours
- **Anonymous Handoff** - Configure whether to request email from anonymous users
- **Custom Fields** - Pass additional context and data during handoff

See individual provider documentation for specific configuration options and setup instructions.
