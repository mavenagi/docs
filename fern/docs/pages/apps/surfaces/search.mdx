Maven offers a search interface that provides a dedicated web-based search experience for your Maven agent.

## Installation

To install the search app on your agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the search app">
    - Navigate to the **Apps** page in the **Agent Designer**
    - Click on **Browse & Install** on the **Apps Directory** tile
    - Search for "Search" and click on the **Search** app tile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the app">
    - Click on the **Install** button
    - See below for details on configuration options
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access

The search interface is accessed directly through a web URL. Users can visit your personalized search interface at:

```
https://search.onmaven.app/${organizationId}/${agentId}
```

Replace `${organizationId}` and `${agentId}` with your actual organization and agent IDs, which can be found in your Maven dashboard.

## Password Protection

The search interface can be protected with HTTP Basic Authentication to restrict access to authorized users only.

### HTTP Basic Auth Configuration

To enable password protection for your search interface:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Basic Auth in Maven Dashboard">
    - Navigate to your search app settings in the Maven dashboard
    - Locate the **HTTP Basic Auth** section under Security settings
    - Enter a **Basic Auth Username** - this will be the username users need to enter
    - Enter a **Basic Auth Password** - this will be the password users need to enter
    - Save your settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Access">
    - Visit your search interface URL: `https://search.onmaven.app/${organizationId}/${agentId}`
    - You should be prompted for username and password
    - Enter the credentials you configured to access the interface
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How It Works

When HTTP Basic Auth is enabled:
- Users visiting your search interface will see a browser authentication dialog
- They must enter the correct username and password to access the search interface
- The authentication is handled at the HTTP level, providing an additional security layer
- This is useful for internal tools, beta testing, or restricting access to specific user groups

<Note>
HTTP Basic Auth provides basic password protection but should not be considered highly secure for sensitive applications. For stronger security, consider using signed user authentication in combination with Basic Auth.
</Note>
