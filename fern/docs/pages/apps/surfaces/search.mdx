Maven Search is a full-page, AI-powered search experience designed to help users find accurate, long-form answers across your knowledge base. Unlike compact widgets, Maven Search provides a dedicated, standalone interface.

**What it does:**

* Delivers conversational search with natural language answers powered by large language models (LLMs).  
* Supports follow-up questions, “See More” responses, and related content to encourage discovery.  
* Handles multilingual input with UTF-8 support for global audiences.  
* Allows users to give feedback, copy responses, and engage seamlessly across devices.  
* Syncs with your connected knowledge sources to ensure current, relevant answers.

**Fully Configurable Experience:**  
The entire experience, branding, logos, colors, font styles, and popular questions—can be configured directly within the app settings. This ensures your Maven Search interface matches your organization’s look and feel.
