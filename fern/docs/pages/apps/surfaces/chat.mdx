Maven offers a chat widget that allow you to embed a Maven experience directly into your website.

To add the chat widget to your website, you need to add a small piece of javascript to your page. 
This javascript code will initialize the widget and connect it to your Maven instance.

Your personalized code snippet can be found on the chat settings 
page within the Dashboard. You'll need to copy and paste the code snippet into your website's HTML to get started. 

## Chat Widget

The chat widget currently supports one additional setting - the welcome message. This message will be
shown to the user when they first open the chat widget. 

The questions shown directly under the welcome message are configured on the Agent Settings page with 
the popular questions setting.

The chat widget's background color and logo at the top of the widget are also configured on the Agent Settings page.
They match the Brand Color and the Horizontal logo, respectively.
