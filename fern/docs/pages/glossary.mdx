## Quality

Maven Quality is a measurement of Maven’s confidence in its own answer. There are three categories of quality:

- **Good:** Maven’s self-assessment is that the answer was both correct and of high quality
- **Needs Improvement:** Maven could not confidently answer the question for one of the reasons below, or because the end user gave the interaction a thumbs down:
  - Missing knowledge
  - Missing action
  - Missing user information
  - Needs user clarification
  - Unsupported format
  - Unsupported user behavior
  - Interrupted

- **Ineligible:** Ineligible indicates one of two quality determinations below: 
  - Maven was unable to make a quality determination and thus could not generate a "needs improvement" category
  - Maven ranked the quality as Good, but an end user marked the conversations as a "thumbs down."

### How Maven Quality is Calculated

Maven Quality takes the following signals into account:

- **Automatic self grading:** Maven has a self-grading mechanism that determines how confident it is based on how much relevant information it has in knowledge and actions
- **Human feedback:** user provided thumbs up and down feedback serves is a strong signal of quality
