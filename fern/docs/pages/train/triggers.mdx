Triggers are used to trigger Maven App execution in response to a system event.

Most customers will add Triggers to their Agent by installing existing Maven Apps via the
App Marketplace. For advanced use cases, Triggers can also be created using the Maven API.

## Example

The most common type of trigger is used to update another system with data from Maven. For example, you could add a tag to every Zendesk ticket where the copilot response was inserted. 

To set this up a Maven App would create a trigger of type `Feedback Created`. This trigger would be visible within the Agent Designer. 

Every time Maven received feedback, it would execute the code within the Maven App passing in the feedback received. This app would then call a Zendesk API to add a tag to the zendesk ticket ID that the feedback referenced.

Over time Maven will add more event and event trigger types. Contact us if you have an immediate need!

## Triggers vs Actions

Trigger code is called in response to an event. Trigger code execution is usually used for data reporting - e.g. exporting to a BI tool like Snowflake or updating a Zendesk ticket with a specific tag whenever a user clicks thumbs down.

[Action code](/help-center/training-maven/actions) is only called in response to a user question, deciding whether an action is called is handled by the LLM. Actions are used to get or update information on behalf of users.

## Trigger Types

Currently, Maven supports these event trigger types:

- **Feedback Created**: The Event Trigger is triggered whenever feedback is created or updated.
- **Conversation Created**: The Event Trigger is triggered whenever a conversation is created or updated.
