Before a user can gain access to any Maven agents, you will have to add them to your Maven organization. You should do this immediately after creating an organization. Additionally, youâ€™ll probably need to add new team members on a case-by-case basis as your organization changes and grows.

## Manage new users and user access

User management is done from the Members page, which can be reached by navigating to **Organization settings > Members**.

At the top of the page, you'll find an overview of users for your organization: the number of total users, joined users, and invited users.

### Invite new users

Only admins and owners can add or remove users.

To invite new users, follow these steps:

1. From the Members page, click **Invite Member**. The Invite New Users modal will appear.
2. Type the new user's name, email address, and role into the dialog. You can add more than one
3. Then click **Next**.

The user will receive and email to join the organization

### Change user roles and permissions

Only admins and owners can add or remove users.

1. Navigate to **Organization settings > Members**. The Team Members page will open.
2. Check the ellipsis next to the name of the user whose permissions you'd like to edit.
3. Click **Change role**
4. In the modal that appears, select the new role and click **Save**

### Removing a user

Only admins and owners can add or remove users.

1. Navigate to **Organization settings > Members**. The Team Members page will open.
2. Check the ellipsis next to the name of the user whose permissions you'd like to edit.
3. Click **Remove** and confirm the action

### Configuring SSO
Admins and owners can configure SSO for their organization from Agent Designer. The following identity providers are supported: 
- Okta
- Entra ID
- ADFS
- Google Workspace
- Custom SAML

To set up SSO: 
1. Navigate to **Organization settings > Security**. The Authentication methods page will open.
2. Click **Set Up** for Enterprise SSO. 
3. A new tab will open. Click through the flow to configure the connection, test SSO, and complete set up. 

To edit the SSO connection in the future, click **Manage**.

Once the SSO connection is set up, users can enable SCIM provisioning in the dropdown under Enterprise SSO. To set up SCIM: 
1. Click **Set up** under **SCIM provisioning not configured**.
2. Map identity provider attributes to user fields for automatic provisioning. Mapping User ID is required to set up SCIM provisioning; email mapping is optional. Click **Confirm** when complete.
3. The Base SCIM URL and Auth token will be shown. Users will only see the Auth token once so copy and store securely. Click **Done** when complete. If needed users can regenerate the auth token by clicking the arrow circle next to **Auth token**.

To edit these SCIM mappings in the future, click **Edit SCIM mappings** in the Enterprise SSO dropdown. 

### Disconnecting SSO 
To disable SCIM connection, click **Remove SCIM** in the Enterprise SSO dropdown. 

To disconnect SSO, click **Disconnect SSO** in the Enterprise SSO dropdown.
