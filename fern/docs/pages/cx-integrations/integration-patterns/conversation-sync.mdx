description: Sync ticket and conversation data for AI training and analytics
---

Conversation Sync imports ticket and conversation data from your helpdesk into Maven for AI training, analytics, and continuous improvement.

## What It Does

- **Historical Import**: Bulk import past tickets for AI training
- **Real-time Sync**: Continuously sync new tickets as they're created and resolved
- **Training Data**: Use real conversations to improve Maven's responses
- **Analytics**: Analyze support patterns and identify automation opportunities

## Supported Platforms

Conversation Sync is available for:

- [Zendesk](/docs/cx-integrations/zendesk)
- [Salesforce](/docs/cx-integrations/salesforce)
- [Freshdesk](/docs/cx-integrations/freshdesk)
- [HubSpot](/docs/cx-integrations/hubspot)
- [Front](/docs/cx-integrations/front)
- [HelpScout](/docs/cx-integrations/helpscout)
- [Intercom](/docs/cx-integrations/intercom)
- [Kustomer](/docs/cx-integrations/kustomer)
- [Zoho Desk](/docs/cx-integrations/zoho)

## How It Works

Maven connects to your helpdesk via API to securely sync conversation data:

1. Configure API credentials and sync settings
2. Select which ticket types/queues to include
3. Maven imports historical data (configurable time range)
4. New tickets sync automatically on an ongoing basis

See your platform-specific guide for setup instructions.
