title: Live Agent Handoff
description: Seamlessly transfer conversations from Maven to human agents
---

Live Agent Handoff enables seamless transitions from Maven's AI chat to human agents in your helpdesk platform.

## What It Does

- **Smart Escalation**: Automatically detect when a conversation needs human intervention
- **Context Preservation**: Transfer full conversation history to the receiving agent
- **Queue Routing**: Route to appropriate agent queues based on topic or priority
- **Warm Handoff**: Agents receive AI-generated summaries before taking over

## Supported Platforms

Live Agent Handoff is available for:

- [Zendesk](/docs/cx-integrations/zendesk)
- [Salesforce](/docs/cx-integrations/salesforce) (Messaging and Legacy)
- [HubSpot](/docs/cx-integrations/hubspot)
- [Front](/docs/cx-integrations/front)
- [Genesys](/docs/cx-integrations/genesys)

## How It Works

When a customer interaction requires human assistance—either through explicit request or AI detection—Maven initiates a handoff:

1. Maven notifies the customer that they're being connected to an agent
2. Full conversation context is packaged and sent to your helpdesk
3. The conversation appears in your agent queue with AI-generated summary
4. Agent picks up seamlessly with full context

See your platform-specific guide for configuration options.
