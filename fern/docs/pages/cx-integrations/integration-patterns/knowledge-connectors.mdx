description: Import knowledge base content from your CX platform
---

Knowledge Connectors import articles and documentation from your helpdesk's knowledge base into Maven's knowledge system.

## What It Does

- **Article Import**: Sync help center articles and documentation
- **Auto-refresh**: Keep content up-to-date with scheduled syncs
- **Category Mapping**: Organize imported content with Maven's taxonomy
- **Access Control**: Respect source visibility settings (public vs. internal)

## Supported Platforms

Knowledge Connectors are available for:

- [Zendesk](/docs/cx-integrations/zendesk) (Guide)
- [Salesforce](/docs/cx-integrations/salesforce) (Knowledge)
- [Freshdesk](/docs/cx-integrations/freshdesk) (Solutions)

## How It Works

Maven connects to your knowledge base and imports content:

1. Configure API access to your knowledge base
2. Select categories/sections to import
3. Maven indexes content for AI retrieval
4. Updates sync on a configurable schedule

See your platform-specific guide for setup instructions.
