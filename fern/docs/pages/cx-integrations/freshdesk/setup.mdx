**Setup within Maven**

Install the Freskdesk app via Agent Designer  
* Navigate to the Agent Designer dashboard  
* Select Apps \> App Directory \> Browse & Install  
* Install Fresdesk

To install, you will need:

* Your FreshDesk API key: How to find your API key  
* Your FreshDesk subdomain: https://yoursubdomain.freshdesk.com  
* Optional language (if left blank, 'en' is the default)
* Optional list of ignore tags for copilot

If it is not successful, double check your subdomain. As an example, if your freshdesk url is http://yourcompany.freshdesk.com, then your subdomain would be “yourcompany”.

**Knowledge:**

Maven will pull in articles from the Freshdesk Knowledge Base. By default, the knowledge base is labeled "Freshdesk". The frequency of the sync/updates can be adjusted by updating the Knowledge Base settings in Maven.
You can also choose to split up the knowledge base by your Freshdesk categories or folders by selecting the appropriate "Knowledge Organization" value.
Please note that if you change this value, you may need to deactivate any existing knowledge bases that were created under a previous setting.
If you want to include unpublished articles, select the "Include Unpublished" option in the settings.

**Ticket Hand Off:**

When Maven cannot deflect a user inquiry, a ticket is created in the Freshdesk system. Ticket hand off is represented as an action within Maven. A ticket can be created for authenticated users and anonymous users.
By default, any fields that are required on your default Freshdesk ticket form will be included in the the form presented to the user on handoff.
If you want to include additional fields you can make them required by going to Admin > Ticket Fields and select the "Required when submitting a ticket" checkbox.
Please note that if these values are modified in Freshdesk, you will need to update the App settings or reinistall the app for the changes to take effect.


**Live Agent Handoff - Comming Q2 2025**
