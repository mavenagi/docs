Maven AGI provides a powerful [Platform API](https://developers.mavenagi.com/docs/api-reference/overview/authentication) which can be leveraged through the use of Apps. Apps make it possible to customize your Maven agent's brain and connect it with the existing systems inside your enterprise environment. If it has an API, it can be plugged into your Agent through Maven Apps.

To get started building your own Maven App, head over to the [Developer Portal](https://developers.mavenagi.com).

## What is a Maven App?

A Maven App is a lightweight application that runs in Maven AGI's hosted environment, allowing you to extend the Maven platform without worrying about managing servers and deployment environments. Apps are the bridge between Maven's AI capabilities and your enterprise systems - enabling you to add custom knowledge sources, actions, user data, and event triggers that are specific to your organization.

## What Can You Build with Maven Apps?

Using the Maven Platform API, you can extend your agent to:

- **Connect Knowledge Sources**: Automatically sync information from your internal systems, databases, and documentation into Maven.
- **Build Custom Actions**: Enable your agent to take actions across any of your systems - create tickets, update records, trigger workflows - while expressing guardrails that ensure you retain control and visibility over every action.
- **Deliver Personalized Experiences**: Pull user context and permissions from your identity providers and CRM systems to tailor interactions for each user.
- **Set Up Event Triggers**: Respond automatically to events in your systems, keeping your agent's knowledge fresh and actions proactive.
- **Create Custom Surfaces**: Develop your own conversational AI user interfaces and products powered by Maven's APIs underneath the hood.

## Deploy on Your Own Infrastructure

For more extensive integrations or applications that need to run on your own infrastructure, you can call the Maven Platform API directly from your servers. These applications use standard authentication headers and an API secret obtained from the [Developer Portal](https://developers.mavenagi.com).

## Open Source and Community

Maven AGI hopes to continue making many of its apps open source, fostering a shared community of knowledge and collaboration. Check out our [public community examples](https://github.com/mavenagi-apps/community-gainsight) to see production-ready Maven Apps you can learn from and build upon.
